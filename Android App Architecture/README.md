####Android app architecture

What is Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Model-View-Presenter (MVP)? What is the difference between them and why is this sort of architecture useful on Android?

  * Testing
  * App architecture
  * Are there tools/libraries that can help with implementing these architectures?
  * How does Realm fit into these kind of architectures? Are there any pitfalls?
