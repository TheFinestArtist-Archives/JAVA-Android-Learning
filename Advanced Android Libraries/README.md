####Advanced Android libraries

What does these libraries do and what problems do they solve? You can write one blogpost/video/presentation about each library, if you want:

  * Dagger (Dependency injection): Why is it usefull? Are there any tradeoffs?
  * Reactive programming (RxJava): What problem does RxJava solve? How does it affect your app architecture. What are the good use cases? and the bad?
  * Roboelectric: what problem does it solve? How does it work?

Does Realm work well with these kind of libraries. Are there any pitfalls?
