ANNOTATION PROCESSING: A MORE EFFICIENT ALTERNATIVE

In Java, annotation processing is a step run before compile time that gathers all annotations defined for a project and enables processors to perform some action. Writing an annotation processor is no easy task, and there are two significant roadblocks: the learning curve and writing the necessary code. The learning curve is daunting because the Annotation Processing API contains a set of unfamiliar and different name classes than its counterpart, the Reflection API. Second, we have write code that writes code that compiles correctly. From this, writing the processor becomes trial and error until the code compiles correctly and runs as expected.
