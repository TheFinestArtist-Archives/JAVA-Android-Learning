#Introduction to Gradle

**This post is for the developers who just started using Gradle.**


###What is Gradle?

   * [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is a project automation tool that builds upon the concepts of [Apache Ant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Ant) and [Apache Maven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven).
   * Gradle introduced [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/)-based [domain-specific language (DSL)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) instead of the more traditional XML form of declaring the project configuration
   * Android introduced Gradle-based Android SDK build system on May 2013.
