#Database
Database is an organized collection of data.

###DBMS (Database Management System)
Database management system provides efficient, reliable, convenient, and safe multi-user storage of and access to massive amounts of persistent data.

##ACID
ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably.

* Atomicity
   * Atomicity requires that each transaction be "all or nothing": if one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails, and the database state is left unchanged.
* Consistency
   * The consistency property ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another.
* Isolation
   * The isolation property ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially, i.e., one after the other.
* Durability
   * Durability means that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors.
