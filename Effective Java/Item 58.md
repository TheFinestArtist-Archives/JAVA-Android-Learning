# Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and runtime exceptions for programming errors#### From <u>[Effective Java 2/e](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/Effective_Java.html?id=ka2VUBqHiWkC&hl=en)</u> by <u>[Joshua Bloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bloch)</u>## The Java programming language provides three kinds of throwables:1. checked exceptions   * use checked exceptions for conditions from which the caller can reasonably be expected to recover2. runtime exceptions (unchecked exceptions)   * Use runtime exceptions to indicate programming errors   * all of the unchecked throwables you implement should subclass RuntimeException3. errors## Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions* Checked exceptions must be explicitly caught or propagated as described in Basic try-catch-finally Exception Handling.* Unchecked exceptions do not have this requirement. They don't have to be caught or declared thrown.* Checked exceptions in Java extend the java.lang.Exception class.* Unchecked exceptions extend the java.lang.RuntimeException.#### Posted by <u>[The Finest Artist](http://thefinestartist.com)
