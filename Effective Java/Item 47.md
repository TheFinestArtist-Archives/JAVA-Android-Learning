#### From <u>[Effective Java 2/e](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/Effective_Java.html?id=ka2VUBqHiWkC&hl=en)</u> by <u>[Joshua Bloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bloch)</u>

## Advantages
1. By using a standard library, you take advantage of the knowledge of the experts who wrote it and the experience of those who used it before you
2. You donâ€™t have to waste your time writing ad hoc solutions to problems that are only marginally related to your work
3. Their performance tends to improve over time, with no effort on your part
4. Libraries also tend to gain new functionality over time
5. You place your code in the mainstream
