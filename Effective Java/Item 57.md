# Use exceptions only for exceptional conditions#### From <u>[Effective Java 2/e](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/Effective_Java.html?id=ka2VUBqHiWkC&hl=en)</u> by <u>[Joshua Bloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bloch)</u>1. Exceptions are, as their name implies, to be used only for exceptional conditions; they should never be used for ordi- nary control flow2. A well-designed API must not force its clients to use exceptions for ordinary control flow**Example #1**<pre class="prettyprint"> // Horrible abuse of exceptions. Don't ever do this!try {   int i = 0;   while(true)      range[i++].climb();} catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {}for (Mountain m : range)   m.climb();</pre>* Because exceptions are designed for exceptional circumstances, there is little incentive for JVM implementors to make them as fast as explicit tests.* Placingcodeinsideatry-catchblockinhibitscertainoptimizationsthatmod- ern JVM implementations might otherwise perform.* The standard idiom for looping through an array doesnâ€™t necessarily result in redundant checks. Modern JVM implementations optimize them away.**Example #2**<pre class="prettyprint">// Do not use this hideous code for iteration over a collection!try {   Iterator&lt;Foo&gt; i = collection.iterator();   while(true) {      Foo foo = i.next();      ...   }} catch (NoSuchElementException e) {}for (Iterator&lt;Foo&gt; i = collection.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {   Foo foo = i.next();   ...}</pre>#### Posted by <u>[The Finest Artist](http://thefinestartist.com)
