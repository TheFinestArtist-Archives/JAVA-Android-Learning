# Favor static member classes over nonstatic

#### From <u>[Effective Java 2/e](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/Effective_Java.html?id=ka2VUBqHiWkC&hl=en)</u> by <u>[Joshua Bloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bloch)</u>

## Four kinds of nested classes

#### static member classes
Ordinary class that happens to be declared inside another class and has access to all of the enclosing classâ€™s members, even those declared private  
i.e. One common use of a static member class is as a public helper class, useful only in conjunction with its outer class

<pre class="prettyprint">
class Outer {
	static class Inner {
		void go() {
			System.out.println("Inner class reference is: " + this);
		}
	}
}

public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Outer.Inner n = new Outer.Inner();
		n.go();
	}
}
</pre>

#### nonstatic member classes
   * Each instance of a nonstatic member class is implicitly associated with an enclosing instance of its containing class
   * You can invoke methods on the enclosing instance or obtain a refer- ence to the enclosing instance using the qualified this construct
   * The association between a nonstatic member class instance and its enclosing instance is established when the former is created
   * The association takes up space in the nonstatic member class instance and adds time to its construction  
   i.e One common use of a nonstatic member class is to define an Adapter  

<pre class="prettyprint">
public class Outer {
   private int x = 100;

   public void makeInner() {
      Inner in = new Inner();
      in.seeOuter();
   }

   class Inner{
      public void seeOuter() {
         System.out.println("Outer x is " + x);
         System.out.println("Inner class reference is " + this);
         System.out.println("Outer class reference is " + Outer.this);
      }
   }

   public static void main(String [] args) {
      Outer o = new Outer();
      Inner i = o.new Inner();
      i.seeOuter();
   }
}
</pre>

#### anonymous classes
One common use of anonymous classes is to create function objects  

<pre class="prettyprint">
button.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){
   public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
      comp.setText("Button has been clicked");
   }
});
</pre>

#### local classes
Local classes are the least frequently used of the four kinds of nested classes. A local class can be declared anywhere a local variable can be declared and obeys the same scoping rules

<pre class="prettyprint">
public class Outer {
	private String x = "outer";

	public void doStuff() {
		class MyInner {
			public void seeOuter() {
				System.out.println("x is " + x);
			}
		}

		MyInner i = new MyInner();
		i.seeOuter();
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Outer o = new Outer();
		o.doStuff();
	}
}

public class Outer {
	private static String x = "static outer";

	public static void doStuff() {
		class MyInner {
			public void seeOuter() {
				System.out.println("x is " + x);
			}
		}

		MyInner i = new MyInner();
		i.seeOuter();
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Outer.doStuff();
	}
}
</pre>
